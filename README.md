## Why it’s interesting
I like how this article treats AI as the next big abstraction, less about “typing code” and more about clearly describing problems and stitching systems together. The part that clicked for me is the idea that our edge won’t be memorizing APIs, but owning context: users, domain, trade-offs, architecture, and trust with stakeholders. It’s a nudge to use AI as a collaborator—great for drafts, exploration, and speed—while we focus on shaping requirements, evaluating quality, and aligning with real business outcomes. Feels less like “the end of programming” and more like graduating from craftsman to strategist.
